        "\n",
        "Tree is special kind of graph, that is conected (there is a path between any two vertices), acyclic (there are no cycles(A cycle is when you can start at one vertix and, passing along the edges, return to it without repeating the edge.)), and if there are n vertices in a tree, then there are always exactly n - 1 edges. So if we say that something is a tree it has to be a connected acyclic graph.\n",

        "2. A tree is one component of a forest. (A forest is an acyclic graph.)\n",
