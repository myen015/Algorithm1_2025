        "Problem 1. Graph Play\n",
        "1. Directed graphs and their transposed graphs\n",
        "\n",
        "A directed graph consists of vertices connected by directed edges.\n",
        "The transpose of a directed graph is obtained by reversing the direction of every edge while keeping the same set of vertices.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, if the original graph contains an edge from vertex A to vertex B, then the transposed graph will contain an edge from B to A. No other changes are made to the graph structure.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Undirected graphs and their inverse (complement) graphs\n",
        "\n",
        "For undirected graphs, the inverse graph usually refers to the complement graph.\n",
        "\n",
        "The complement of an undirected graph is constructed by connecting two distinct vertices if and only if there is no edge between them in the original graph. Self-loops are not allowed.\n",
        "\n",
        "As a result, all missing edges in the original graph appear in the inverse graph, and all original edges are removed.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What happens if the original graph is dense\n",
        "\n",
        "If the original graph is dense, meaning it contains almost all possible edges, then its inverse (complement) graph will be sparse and contain very few edges.\n",
        "\n",
        "Conversely, if the original graph is sparse, its inverse graph will be dense. Thus, graph density is inverted when taking the complement.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Very simple undirected graphs and their dual graphs\n",
        "\n",
        "The dual graph is defined for planar graphs, which are graphs that can be drawn on a plane without edge crossings.\n",
        "\n",
        "In a dual graph, each face of the planar graph is represented as a vertex. Two vertices in the dual graph are connected by an edge if the corresponding faces in the original graph share a common edge.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, a simple triangle has an inner face and an outer face. These two faces become vertices in the dual graph, connected by an edge.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Why the dual graph is only well-defined for planar graphs\n",
        "\n",
        "The definition of a dual graph relies on the existence of well-defined faces, which only occur when a graph has a planar embedding.\n",
        "\n",
        "Problem 2. Bron–Kerbosch Algorithm Execution\n",
        "\n",
        "We consider an undirected graph with vertices A, B, C, and D. Vertices A, B, and C form a triangle, and vertex D is connected only to vertex C.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Initial call of the algorithm\n",
        "\n",
        "At the beginning, the set R, representing the current clique, is empty.\n",
        "The set P contains all vertices of the graph, since all of them are potential candidates to be added to the clique.\n",
        "The set X is empty, because no vertices have been processed yet.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. First recursive steps leading to a maximal clique\n",
        "\n",
        "The algorithm first adds a vertex from P, for example vertex A, to the set R.\n",
        "The set P is then restricted to vertices that are adjacent to A.\n",
        "\n",
        "Next, vertex B is added to R. The set P is again restricted to vertices that are adjacent to both A and B.\n",
        "\n",
        "When vertex C is added, the set P becomes empty, and the set X is also empty. This indicates that a maximal clique has been found.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Maximal cliques of the graph and the maximum one\n",
        "\n",
        "In this graph, there are two maximal cliques. One consists of the vertices A, B, and C. The other consists of the vertices C and D.\n",
        "\n",
        "The maximum clique is the clique containing vertices A, B, and C, since it has the largest number of vertices"
