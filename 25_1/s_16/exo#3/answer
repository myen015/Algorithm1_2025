Problem 1: Fibonacci
- Matrix exponentiation gives O(log n) time via exponentiation by squaring
- Recurrence: T(n) = T(n/2) + O(1) → Master Theorem Case 1 → O(log n)

Problem 2: Knapsack
- Greedy fails: example items (60,10), (100,20), (120,30), W=50
- Greedy gives 160, optimal is 220
- DP with O(W) space: iterate backwards to avoid reusing items

Problem 3: Neuro Computing
- Similarities are Gaussian distributed (CLT)
- Larger N → smaller variance (Law of Large Numbers)
- Sparse vectors count: C(2000,5) ≈ 2.65e14
- Capacity: number of nearly orthogonal patterns storable
