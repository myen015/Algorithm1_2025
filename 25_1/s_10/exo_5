Problem 1

1 - Connected + no cycles
2 - A piece of a forest: (forest = graph with no cycles)
3 - Connected with precisely V-1 edges
4 - Any edge removed will break connectivity.
5 - No cycles + at least V-1 edges
6 - Adding any edge will create a cycle
7 - Exactly one path between any two vertices



1 → 2:
If we have a connected acyclic graph, then by Def 1, it's automatically one connected component.
A forest is an acyclic graph, so our graph is one component in a forest

2 → 1:
If it is one component of a forest, then by definition it is connected-one component-and acyclic-since forests are acyclic.

1 → 3:
A connected acyclic graph must have V-1 edges. We can prove it by induction:
Base case: V=1, 0 edges.
Assume true for V=k vertices
Add vertex k+1: for connectivity w/o cycles, exactly 1 new edge must be added
So from V=k+1, we have (k-1)+1 = k edges
If we had fewer than V-1 edges, the graph couldn't be connected; if more, cycles would appear

3 → 4:
A connected graph with V-1 edges is minimally connected. Why? If we remove any edge, we would have V-2 edges,
which is insufficient to connect V vertices(minimum V-1 edges needed for connectivity)

4 → 5:
A minimally connected graph must be acyclic. If there were a cycle, we could remove any edge from that cycle without disconnecting the graph,
contradicting minimal connectivity. Since it's connected and minimal it has precisely V-1 edges, which meets "acyclic with at least V-1 edges"

5 → 6:
An acyclic graph with at least V-1 edges must have exactly V-1 edges(since more would create cycles).
That makes it maximally acyclic - adding any edge between non-adjacent vertices would create a cycle, since there's already exactly 1 path between them

6 → 7:
A maximally acyclic graph is a graph with a unique path between all vertices. If no path existed between two vertices,
we could add an edge without creating a cycle. If there were multiple paths between vertices a cycle would already exist.

7 → 1:
Clearly, if there is a unique path between each pair of vertices, the graph will be connected.
It's also acyclic because any cycle would give two different paths between the same vertices
