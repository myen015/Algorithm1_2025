For Problem 1, I wrote a simple function to reverse a directed graph in O(V+E) time and demonstrated it by printing the reversed edges from the given example. For Problem 2, I checked if a graph has an Euler tour by comparing in/out degrees, then used a stack-based algorithm to find and print one for a small cycle graph. For Problem 3, I implemented DFS topological sort starting from A, G, and D, outputting the course orderings like A B D C E G F. It all runs and prints results directly.

Output:
1)
Reversed edges:
B -> A
C -> A
C -> B
D -> B
E -> C
E -> D
E -> G
F -> D
F -> G

2)
Euler tour: A -> B -> C -> A

3)
Topo from A: G A B D F C E
Topo from G: A B D C G E F
Topo from D: G A B C D F E
