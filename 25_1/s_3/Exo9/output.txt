So basically in problem 1, I created a function to count possible finite functions for different outputs and printed examples for n=2. For Problem 2, I defined NAND, then built NOT, AND, and OR from it, showing their truth tables to prove equivalence. For Problem 3, I approximated the circuit size for delta functions as O(n) and calculated the total for F as O(n * 2^n), using n=3 as a demo. The code runs and outputs results directly, with a tiny approximation flaw in sizing.

output:
1)
Functions to {0,1}: 16
Functions to {-1,0,1}: 81
Functions to {0,1}^m (m=2): 256

2)
NOT from NAND:
0 -> 1
1 -> 0
AND from NAND:
0 0 -> 0
0 1 -> 0
1 0 -> 0
1 1 -> 1
OR from NAND:
0 0 -> 0
0 1 -> 1
1 0 -> 1
1 1 -> 1

3)
For n=3, one delta size: 4
Total circuit size: 32
