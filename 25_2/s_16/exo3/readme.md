# Problem Set 3

## Problems

### 1. Fibonacci
- Matrix method: O(log n)
- Master Theorem: a=1, b=2, c=0
- Verified with operation counting

### 2. Knapsack
- DP solution: O(n*W)
- Greedy fails (showed example)
- Finds which items selected
- Tested edge cases

### 3. Binary Vectors
- Similarities are Gaussian (CLT)
- Sparse: C(2000,5) = 254 billion
- Capacity: 38 bits

## Notes
- Has Master Theorem derivations
- Operation counting verification
- Edge cases tested
