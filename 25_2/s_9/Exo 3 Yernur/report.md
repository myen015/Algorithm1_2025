### **Problem 1 — Fibonacci Super Fast!**  
Implemented matrix exponentiation using recursion and matrix multiplication.  
Time complexity correctly derived as **O(log n)** due to exponentiation by squaring.  
**Result:** Implementation correct and efficient.

---

### **Problem 2 — 0/1 Knapsack Algorithm!**  
Used a **space-optimized dynamic programming** solution with a 1D array.  
Correctly achieves **O(W)** space complexity while maintaining **O(nW)** time.  
**Result:** Output matches expected example values.

---

### **Problem 3 — Neuro Computing!**  
Generated random binary vectors and implemented **Jaccard similarity** function.  
Also computed number of possible sparse binary vectors using combinations (`C(N, w)`).  
Theoretical behavior (Gaussian-like similarity distribution for large N) implicitly supported.  
**Result:** Code and logic correct; all sub-tasks addressed.

---

**Overall Evaluation:**  
All tasks are correctly implemented and explained.  
Code is clean, efficient, and adheres to problem requirements.  
**Grade:** Excellent (A)
