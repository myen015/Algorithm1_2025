# Problem Set 8 Overview

The first section covers Strong Connected Components (SCC) and graph reversal. It includes an algorithm to compute the reversal of a directed graph in linear time and provides proofs demonstrating that the Strong Component Graph is always acyclic and preserves reachability logic.

The second section focuses on Euler Tours. It proves that a directed graph has an Euler tour if and only if every vertex has equal in-degree and out-degree. It also describes an algorithm to find this tour by merging edge-disjoint cycles.

Finally, the third section applies Topological Search to a specific course dependency graph. It demonstrates how to find valid course orderings starting from specific nodes like 'A' or by generating random valid sorts.
