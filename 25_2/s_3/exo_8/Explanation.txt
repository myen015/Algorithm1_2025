Problem 1 (SCC and Graph Reversal)
To reverse a directed graph G in O(V+E), iterate over all edges and add each reversed edge to a new adjacency list. 
The strong component graph scc(G) is acyclic because any cycle among components would imply vertices belong to the same component, 
which is a contradiction. For all vertices u and v, u can reach v in G if and only if S(u) can reach S(v) in scc(G). 
Reversing G preserves strong components, and edges in scc(G) are reversed in scc(rev(G)), so scc(rev(G)) = rev(scc(G)).

Problem 2 (Euler Tour)
A strongly connected directed graph has an Euler tour if and only if in-degree equals out-degree for each vertex. 
This is because each visit along a cycle must enter and leave vertices the same number of times. 
The Euler tour can be constructed in O(E) time using Hierholzer's algorithm: build cycles along unused edges and merge them iteratively until all edges are used.

Problem 3 (Topological Sort)
Given a DAG, topological sort orders vertices respecting edge directions. Starting from A in the course graph example, one valid order is A, B, C, D, G, E, F. 
Starting from G or with different tie-breaking, other valid orders include G, A, B, C, D, E, F or A, B, D, C, G, E, F. 
The topological sort can be implemented using Kahn’s algorithm with a priority choice for vertices with zero in-degree.
